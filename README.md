# Neon Tetromino #

All you need to run it is a static web server although I will most likely be converting it into a Cordova application to try selling on the app store(s).

To get it running:
Clone the repo
cd into the directory
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Go to http://localhost:8000/ and play some Tetris.

*** Note the name Tetris is under trademark hence I use the term tetromino which describes a four block shape. ***
